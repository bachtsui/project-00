Racing Game

Square Blue vs Square Orange, who will come out on top of this epic race?!
Only you the player can decide the outcome.

Technologies Used
I rendered the players and the board by creating a canvas.
I learned about this method through stack overflow and Google.

Players were created using Objects that we learned in class.
Was trying to figure out if I could make movement a method
using prototype, but went with switch state route instead.

Existing Features

D key moves Sqaure Blue to the right
Right Arrow moves Square Orange to the right

Whichever square moves past the edge first, wins!
Very exciting, GOTY edition!

Planned Features
Not sure, this was just a test to build up on for Game 2 and Game 3
